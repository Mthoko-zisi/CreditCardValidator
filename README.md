# 💳 CreditCard.py

## 👋🏾 About the Project
This is a simple Python script I built to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. It also masks all digits except the last four to protect sensitive information. No APIs, no external libraries—just clean Python logic. It's a great way to practice string manipulation, conditionals, and algorithmic thinking.

## 🚀 What It Does
- Accepts credit card numbers (with or without spaces/dashes)
- Masks the number like: `**** **** **** 1234`
- Checks validity using the Luhn checksum
- Gives clear output: `VALID` or `INVALID`
